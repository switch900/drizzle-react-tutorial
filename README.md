"A Tutorial creating a Truffle project with React and Drizzle from scratch. This way we can gain the best understanding of how Drizzle works under the hood. With this knowledge, you can leverage the full power of Drizzle with any front-end framework of your choosing, or use the higher-level React abstractions with confidence.

This will be a very minimal tutorial focused on setting and getting a simple string stored in a contract. It's meant for those with a basic knowledge of Truffle, who have some knowledge of JavaScript and React.js, but who are new to using Drizzle."
